\section*{Abstract}

The objective of this term paper is to provide readers with an introduction 
to the concepts associated with the bootstrapping process. 
The following sections aim to provide an overview of the process, 
as well as an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the procedure 
discussed in this paper. While some basic knowledge of statistics is undoubtedly 
beneficial for those wishing to gain familiarity with the subject matter, 
this paper is intended to serve as an introductory guide for any interested 
reader. Consequently, the fundamental concepts and underlying logic of 
bootstrapping should be accessible and comprehensible even to those with 
no prior experience or knowledge in this field. The use of practical examples 
and illustrative implementations will facilitate a deeper understanding of the 
subject matter.
